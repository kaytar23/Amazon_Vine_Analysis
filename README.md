## Summary

Looking at the data, there does appear to be a bias towards positive reviews within the Vine program. The general public gives a 5 star review to video games about 38% of the time so if the Vine program was representative of what people think then the percentage of 5 star reviews in the program would be closer to that number. However, the percentage of 5 stars reviews within the program are over 50%, which would indicate that they are more likely to give good reviews inside the program.
